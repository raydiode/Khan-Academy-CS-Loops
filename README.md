# Rising Raindrops Animation
A JavaScript animation project creating colourful rising drops that grow as they float upward.

I started the Khan Academy Course on computer programming. This was one of the excercises. I worked on it with an AI assistant, asking questions and advice (and sometimes encouragement!) on the way. I have included links to the tools and the course. After working on it, I asked Claude.ai to summarise our conversation and provide a tutorial. I then asked it to write the code as a x10 developer to provide an example of something to aspire to. I then asked it to write me a "comparison.md" so I could learn the differences between what I did and what I could do as I gain more experience.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts through an interactive animation. It shows how to:
- Create and manage multiple objects using parallel arrays
- Handle dynamic object creation and removal
- Implement basic collision detection
- Work with colours and animation
- Control object growth and movement

## Core Concepts Covered
- Arrays and array manipulation
- Random number generation
- Animation loops
- Collision detection
- Colour manipulation
- Object lifecycle management

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- [Khan Academy's ProcessingJS environment](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming)
- Developed with assistance from [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai/)

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, you'll learn about:
- Array management (push, splice)
- Loop structures
- Conditional statements
- Animation timing
- Object position tracking
- Colour randomisation
- Collision prevention algorithms
